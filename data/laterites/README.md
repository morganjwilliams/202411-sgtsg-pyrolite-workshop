CSIRO-AGE Database: Geochemical analyses from systematic collection of lateritic materials for mineral exploration 
over parts of the Yilgarn Craton and Alban-Fraser Province.  Some 8000 samples were collected, 1980-1986, and 
samples analysed for up to 31 major, minor and trace elements.  Focus was on systemic sampling of surface 
and near surface lateritic materials with 3 km spacing for first pass, with 1 km follow-up of anomalies.
Lateritic residua included lateritic gravels, pisoliths, nodules, duricrust, and ferricrete.

The research project was led by Ray Smith of CSIRO with exploration activities led by Roger M Thomson, 
Exploration Manager for Greenbushes Ltd.  John Perdrix and Tony Dod provided data management.  Through the 
1990s, John Wildman (CSIRO) consolidated the data for archiving.  Paul Morris (Geological Survey of WA) 
and Ray Smith liaised for publication of the data as GSWA Record 1998/8, authored by J R Gozzard.  
In retirement, Ray Smith as a CSIRO Honorary Fellow, reassembled the legacy data (circ. 2017) as presented here.
